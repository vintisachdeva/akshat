Intent--> Predefined class in android

Intent--> 

1) when we want to switch from one screen to another then intent is used.

2) when we want to pass data on second screen.

3) when we want to perform any action.eg--> when we click a button within our app and then that redirect as on another app in phone.

4) when we have to start any service in background

5) when we have to make any broadcast message


Two types of Intent:

1) Implicit intent
2) Explicit intent

Implict intent: to perform any action. switching from one app to another app--> outside app

Explicit intent: to start another activity or pass data from one activity to another activity then explicit intents are used.--> within app
